Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
Answer each prompt with 3â€“5 bullet points:

Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
I learned about what the requirements are to complete the project.
I learned how to organize my files and folders. 
I learned how to create a planning board for the project to ensure I stay on track. 

Concept Connections: Which Week 1â€“10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
I feel confident in SQL and performing searches on databases. 
I still need to work on for loops and try/except blocks.

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
Not at this time

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?
Slack/Fellows/TAs/Videos

ðŸ§  Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.

#	Feature Name	Difficulty (1â€“3)	Why You Chose It / Learning Goal
1	City Comparison, Difficulty: 1		
2	Theme Switcher, Difficulty: 2
3   Activity Suggester, Difficulty: 3 

 Section 3: High-Level Architecture Sketch
Add a diagram or a brief outline that shows:

Core modules and folders:
core/weather_api.py	
core/storage.py	
core/error_handling.py	
config/weatherapi.py	
.env	
main.py	

Feature modules:
features/city_comparison.py	Co
features/theme_switcher.py	
features/activity_suggester.py

Data flow between components:
User Input (GUI: main.py)
   â†“
City Name â†’ core.weather_api.get_weather(city)
   â†“
Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)
   â†“
Response JSON â†’ core.weather_api â†’ main.py
   â†“
main.py updates GUI:
   - Shows weather info
   - Saves last searched city via core.storage.save_last_city()
   - Handles errors via core.error_handling

Optional:
 - Features like theme_switcher or activity_suggester are triggered by user interaction
 - All use shared core + config functions

Section 4: Data Model Plan
Fill in your planned data files or tables:

File/Table Name	Format (txt, json, csv, other)	Example Row
weather_history.txt	txt	2025-06-09,New Brunswick,78,Sunny

| File/Table Name      | Format | Example Row                                      |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| weather\_history.txt | txt    | 2025-06-09,New Brunswick,78,Sunny                |
| last\_city.txt       | txt    | New Brunswick                                    |
| settings.ini         | ini    | `[Preferences]``theme=day``units=metric` |

Section 5: Personal Project Timeline (Weeks 12â€“17)
Customize based on your availability:

Week	Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Key Milestone
12	API setup	Error handling	Tkinter shell	Buffer day	Basic working app
13	Feature 1			Integrate	Feature 1 complete
14	Feature 2 start		Review & test	Finish	Feature 2 complete
15	Feature 3	Polish UI	Error passing	Refactor	All features complete
16	Enhancement	Docs	Tests	Packaging	Ready-to-ship app
17	Rehearse	Buffer	Showcase	â€“	Demo Day

Section 6: Risk Assessment
Identify at least 3 potential risks and how youâ€™ll handle them.

| Risk                        | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan                                                 
| API Rate Limit              | Medium     | Medium | Cache recent weather results to avoid repeated calls; add delay/retry logic on failure.             |
| Missing/Invalid API Key     | Low        | High   | Check API key presence on app startup; show clear error and instructions if missing or invalid.     |
| Network Connectivity Issues | Medium     | High   | Gracefully handle network errors with user-friendly messages; allow offline mode with cached data.  |
| File Read/Write Errors      | Low        | Medium | Use try-except blocks for file operations; inform user if saving/loading fails and fallback safely. |


Section 7: Support Requests
What specific help will you ask for in office hours or on Slack?
I am not sure yet, probably help with code
